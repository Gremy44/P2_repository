For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noahâs Ark following the Great Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and Armenia.Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountainâs nearly 17 000-foot summit  trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians  for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes  whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak  recounting the genocide of Armenians and its unresolved debate  or depicting the Kurdsâ ambitions for their own nationâs borders  which some say should include Mount Ararat.What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noahâs Ark is one manâs odyssey  a tale told through many stories. Starting with the flooding of the Black Sea in 5600 BCE  through to the Epic of Gilgamesh and the contrasting narratives of the Great Flood known to followers of the Judaic  Christian and Islamic religions  Full Moon Over Noahâs Ark takes readers along with Antonson through the shadows and broad landscapes of Turkey  Iraq  Iran and Armenia  shedding light on a troubled but fascinating area of the world. ...more,Travel,4 étoiles,http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/fe/8a/fe8af6ceec7718986380c0fde9b3b34f.jpg
