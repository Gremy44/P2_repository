If you wanted to get literal  it is about an inner city boy  Sinclair  who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings. With these wings  Sinclair flies around the city and gets into adventures."" - Farel Dalrymple  series creator From Publishers Weekly: Collecting the first five issues of Dalrymple's acclaimed comic book series Pop Gun War  this book provides a capsule look at Dalrymple's vision of urban fantasy. Set in New York  his stories follow characters with wings  talking fish  giants  dwarves and other fantastical acquaintances and ideas. At the center of it all is a boy named Sinclair  who acquires a set of wings when a tattooed  disgruntled angel pays to have them cut off. Sinclair  a lonely kid prone to bowties and being teased  sets off on a series of encounters across the city. His older sister  a singer in a rock band  is an inspiration and worry; a homeless man of unknown powers and origins joins him; and a band of youths pursue him. Dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink style highly dynamic and tailor-made for depicting New York's teeming city streets. He has a flair for the dramatic as well scenes of Sinclair flying  or of a giant walking the streets  are genuinely affecting  while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism. The story meanders a bit  and it's not always clear where it's headed  but the fun of Pop Gun War is in its vivid characters and details. It is a fine debut  reminiscent of DC Comics's Vertigo line  with which it should sit comfortably on bookstores' and adventurous readers' shelves. ...more",Sequential Art,1 étoile
